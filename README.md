# Hire an Adventurer!!

This app is designed to be a simple e-commerce app, except that instead of buying stuff, you are hiring mercenary fantasy adventurers to slay monsters that are threatening your village!

You will have a set number of silver coins, and can try as may times as you like to defeat the monsters (as long as you have enough silver and living adventurers to recruit from)!  Your score will be tallied as you go, and is based on the strength of the monsters you have defeated.

How high can you get your score??

Good luck!
