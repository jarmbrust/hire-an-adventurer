# Hire an Adventurer!!

This app is designed to be a simple e-commerce app, except that instead of buying stuff, you are hiring mercenary fantasy adventurers to slay monsters that threatening you village!

You will have a set number of silver coins, and can try as may times as you like to defeat the monsters (as long as you have the silver and living adventurers to recruit from)!  Your score will be tallied as you go, and is based on the strength of the monsters you have defeated.

How high can you score??

Good luck!


## Technical

This was created with React 19 with Next.js as the framework.  Styling is done with Tailwind, and backend is simulated at this time, doing api calls but getting the information from JSON files (I have plans to rectify this at some point coming up).

This site is designed to be responsive for mobile.
